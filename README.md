## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openshift-sandbox.git
   cd openshift-sandbox
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. For example, if using Node.js:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **OpenShift Login:**
   Log in to your OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift CLI:
   ```sh
   oc login --token=YOUR_TOKEN --server=YOUR_SERVER_URL
   ```

2. **Set up your project:**
   Create a new project (namespace) in OpenShift:
   ```sh
   oc new-project sandbox-project
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Deploy the application:**
   Use the provided template to deploy your application:
   ```sh
   oc apply -f deployment/templates/app-template.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:**
   Check the status of your pods to ensure they are running:
   ```sh
   oc get pods
   ```

## Usage

Once deployed, your application should be accessible through the route provided by OpenShift. You can find the route using:
```sh
oc get routes
```

Access your application by navigating to the URL displayed in the routes list.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Pod Logs:**
   ```sh
   oc logs <pod-name>
   ```

2. **Describe Resources:**
   ```sh
   oc describe <resource-type> <resource-name>
   ```

3. **Consult OpenShift Documentation:**
   Refer to the [OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/) for more detailed troubleshooting steps.
